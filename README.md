# SimpleBinder

SimpleBinder is a Windows Forms application that allows you to assign simulated input of certain phrases using hotkeys. The application has the following features:

- Enable and disable simulated input by a selected key.
- Change the hotkey for enabling and disabling simulated input.
- Minimize the application to tray and disable this feature if needed.
- Change the theme and language of the interface (Russian or English).
- Save the states of the application (theme, language, hotkey, simulated input state, tray minimization state) and automatically load them on startup.
- Save and automatically load the values of binds (phrases for simulated input).

The application is created using C# and Windows Forms - a technology for creating graphical user interfaces for Windows. The application can be useful for those who often use the same phrases when working with a computer or games.
